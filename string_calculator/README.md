# String Calculator - TDD Kata

This is a **String Calculator** application developed using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles. The calculator can handle basic arithmetic operations on numbers provided in a string format. It supports both default delimiters (comma `,` and newline `\n`) and custom delimiters defined by the user.

## Features

- Supports **default delimiters**: comma (`,`) and newline (`\n`).
- Allows **custom delimiters** in the format `//[delimiter]\n[numbers]`.
- Handles edge cases like:
  - Empty input strings.
  - Non-numeric values.
  - Negative numbers (throws an error).
- **Test-Driven Development**: All features were developed with TDD.
